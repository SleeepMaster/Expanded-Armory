# EXPANDED ARMORY

When I first played Steamworld Heist I had a blast with this game, however I felt it was lacking powerful very rare weapons. This is why I created this mod.

[You can download it here](https://github.com/SleeepMaster/Expanded-Armory/releases/download/v1.0.1/mod_expanded_armory.rar).

# MOD FEATURES

- New rarity tier: **`Legendary`**.
- 15 new Legendary weapons and items.
- 8 new Rare weapons and items.
- 9 new Common weapons.

**`Legendary`** items and weapons are twice as rare as Rare weapons. You can find them in any Swag bag through out the game.

Each act has 5 Legendaries to find.

I tried to keep this mod as balanced as possible, but if you think something is overpowered or underpowered feel free to leave feedback in the posts section.

# INSTALLATION

### ***WARNING! ONCE YOU INSTALL THIS MOD YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LOAD YOUR SAVE WITHOUT IT, SO MAKE SURE TO MAKE A COPY OF YOUR SAVE FILES.***

Place **`mod_expanded_armory`** folder into DLC folder of your SteamWorld Heist directory, for example:
```

```

When you load a save, a popup window should appear confirming that the mod has been installed.
